## System Overview

SysInsight is a code-driven database tuning system that automatically extracts fine-grained tuning knowledge from DBMS source code to accelerate and stabilize the tuning process. The tuning workflow involves seven steps:

ðŸ“Œ User provides the DBMS to be tuned (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL), the target workload, and the optimization objective (e.g., throughput or latency).

ðŸ“Œ SysInsight performs static analysis on DBMS source code using LLVM IR to construct function-knob mappings, identifying which functions are controlled by each configuration parameter through data-flow and control-flow analysis.

ðŸ“Œ SysInsight employs LLM-based code reasoning with iterative AST search to formulate semantic tuning hypotheses, understanding how knobs influence system execution paths and performance implications.

ðŸ“Œ SysInsight conducts hypothesis-guided experimentation and applies customized association rule mining to derive empirically validated tuning rules with explicit conditions, adjustments, and confidence scores.

ðŸ“Œ During online tuning, SysInsight performs system diagnosis using flame graphs and SHAP analysis to identify performance bottleneck functions and selects relevant knobs based on function-knob mappings.

ðŸ“Œ SysInsight retrieves applicable tuning rules and hypotheses matching the current runtime context, then generates configuration recommendations through rule-augmented LLM prompting.

ðŸ“Œ Finally, SysInsight applies the suggested configuration, observes performance feedback, and continuously updates rule statistics to maintain reliability and enable knowledge refinement for future tuning tasks.

## Quick Start
The following instructions assume you are running on Ubuntu 20.04+ and have Python 3.8+ installed:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blairruc-pku/SysInsight.git
cd SysInsight
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
conda create -n sysinsight python=3.9
conda activate sysinsight
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Install and Configure Additional Tools

SysInsight leverages Linux perf and other system utilities. Please ensure they are installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`
```

### Step 4: Install PostgreSQL
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-14
```

### Step 5: run
```
./run.sh
```
